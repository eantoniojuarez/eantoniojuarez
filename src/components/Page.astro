I grew up in NYC, and am currently studying at Cornell University in Ithaca, NY. I started drawing in middle school after a friend lent me a few comic books, and I fell in love with the medium. Since then, I worked art fundamentals in order to be able to tell cool, clear stories with flashy and hopefully appealing art! I mainly draw digitally, which allows me to work quickly, jumping from thumbnails and sketch to inks and line art. A lot of my personal work is in the realm of science fiction, however I also have experience drawing super heroes and fantasy. I have a personal comic book project I am working on which makes up a lot of this portfolio. I have also spent a significant amount of time at my college working on indie game development as an artist, so I have experience with working on projects from start to finish, from mood boarding, to concept art and idea generation, to final assets and products.",
