        caption: `Super Food Chain! is a snake-like game where you control a chain of various produce in order to fight off waves of bosses and their minions.
        
        The game was produced in the Spring 2025 semester by a team of 5 programmers and 3 designers for Cornell University's CIS/INFO 3152 Intro to Game Development class. 
        
        I worked on all the main character animations and assets, as well as promotional stuff such as the banner/title screen (below), game icon/cover (left), and stickers handed out during our in-person final showcase. 
        I also had input on stuff such as level design, and player/boss interactions. 
        
        Throughout the project one main concern was handling the workload of drawing all the assets fast while also retaining a consistent high quality of all the assets`,
