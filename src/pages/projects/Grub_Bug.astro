        As we progressed through building the game, we realized it could become a bit difficult to see the characters, especially as the game was being designed to be fast paced and hectic. We pivoted to making the game brighter and having it lean into the chaos of the gameplay. 
        
        We kept the original story for the game, and the new environment keeps the concept from taking itself too seriously and motivates the player to play as best they can to help out the more cheerful main character.`,
